I've been a personal trainer since 2013 and since 2024 also a posture specialist.\nMy workouts mainly focus on weightlifting, reactivation and muscle toning, and also functional training and tabata.\nWith my recent studies in posturology, I have learned the importance of correct posture and how postural irregularities can affect sports performance. By integrating and incorporating them into my sessions, I have been able to see real results.\nMy goal is aesthetic improvement, toning and increasing muscle mass by integrating correct posture, improving sports performance and muscle elasticity through structured and customized protocols for each individual."
